#Marketing Campaign Analysis – Facebook vs. AdWords (A/B Testing)
Business Problem
As a marketing agency, our goal is to maximize ROI for our clients. We ran two advertising campaigns — one on Facebook and another on Google AdWords — and needed to evaluate:
Which platform performs better in terms of clicks, conversions, and cost-effectiveness?
Where should we reallocate budget for optimal performance?
--

## Research Question
Which ad platform delivers:
More conversions
Better Click-Through Rate (CTR)
Higher cost-efficiency (CPC and cost per conversion)?
--

## Solution Overview
We conducted a full analysis of the daily ad performance for both platforms across 2019 using:
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Hypothesis testing (A/B testing)
Linear Regression Modeling
Statistical interpretation
--

## Tools & Technologies
Python: pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, numpy, scipy, sklearn, statsmodels
Jupyter Notebook
A/B Testing Methodology

##Project Workflow
1. Data Cleaning
Converted spend and conversion columns to numeric
Handled missing/null values
Corrected data types
--
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Trend analysis across time
Platform-wise metric comparisons
--
3. Statistical Testing
Performed A/B testing on conversion rates
Assessed significance of mean differences
--
4. Correlation & Regression
Measured relationships between impressions, clicks, and conversions
Built linear regression to estimate conversion impact from ad spend

## Key Insights & Recommendations
Facebook delivered higher CTR and lower CPC
AdWords delivered more conversions but at higher cost
Recommend 65% budget allocation to Facebook for better ROI
Regression showed diminishing returns beyond a certain daily spend
